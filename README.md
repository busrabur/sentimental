# Sentiment-Analysis
Csv file of Turkish lexicon that is used in our project (Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: A Text Mining Approach to the Syrian Refugee Crisis) is added. Words are scored by 3 different people who are univesity graduates, then average of the scores are taken and used in the project as final sentiment scores.
