# Sentiment-Analysis
Csv file of Turkish lexicon that is used in our project (Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: A Text Mining Approach to the Syrian Refugee Crisis) is added. Words are scored by 3 different people who are univesity graduates, then average of the scores are taken and used in the project as final sentiment scores. 
This Turkish lexicon is public available for research. The details are described in [Öztürk and Ayvaz, 2017].
Please include this citation if you plan to use this lexicon:
